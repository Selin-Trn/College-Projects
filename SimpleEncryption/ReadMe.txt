Encryption

Our purpose is to write a simple encryption program.
The program asks for user input and then it capitalizes the input (character string).
By extracting the lowest ASCII value from the highest of these characters, the program creates a key for encryption.
Lastly, the program adds the key value to the ASCII values of the string and creates the encrypted string.
